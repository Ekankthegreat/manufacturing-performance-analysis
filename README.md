## ðŸ“Š Dataset
Quarterly Equipment Efficiency Rate - 2024:
- Q1: 70.2
- Q2: 72.01
- Q3: 75.81
- Q4: 81.46

**Average Efficiency Rate:** 74.87  
**Industry Target:** 90

---

## ðŸ”Ž Key Findings
1. The companyâ€™s average efficiency rate (74.87) is well below the industry benchmark (90).  
2. A gradual improvement is seen across quarters (Q1 â†’ Q4).  
3. Despite the upward trend, the efficiency gap remains significant.  
4. Increasing downtime and maintenance costs are driving the lower efficiency.

## ðŸ’¼ Business Implications
- The current efficiency shortfall (74.87 vs 90) results in higher operating costs and lost production capacity.  
- If not addressed, competitive disadvantage will widen in the upcoming fiscal year.  

---

## âœ… Recommendations
The executive team should **implement a predictive maintenance program**.  
- Predict equipment failures before they occur.  
- Reduce downtime and maintenance costs.  
- Improve efficiency rates to meet or exceed the 90 target.
